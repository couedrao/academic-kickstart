I’m a junior researcher in LAAS-CNRS. My research aims to reduce human involvement in IoT Platforms to speed up the innovation loop of networking infrastructure. 

I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Christophe CHASSOT](http://homepages.laas.fr/chassot/pmwiki/pmwiki.php), [Samir MEDJIAH](http://homepages.laas.fr/smedjiah/), and [Khalil DRIRA](http://homepages.laas.fr/khalil/page/index.php). 

I earned my Master's degree in innovative smart systems at INSA Toulouse (in France) in 2017. Prior to INSA, I have completed my engineering diploma in network and telecommunications at [ENSA Safi](http://www.ensas.uca.ma/) (in Morocco) in 2016.
